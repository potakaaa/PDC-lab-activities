## 📖 About

This repository contains laboratory exercises and projects for **Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC)**. Each lab builds on core concepts—from basic concurrency primitives to task and data parallelism—using Python's standard library.

### What You'll Explore

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Concurrency** | Multiple tasks making progress over time |
| **Parallelism** | Multiple tasks executing simultaneously |
| **GIL** | Global Interpreter Lock and its implications |
| **Threading** | Lightweight execution for I/O-bound work |
| **Multiprocessing** | True parallelism for CPU-bound work |
| **Executors** | High-level abstractions for parallel execution |

## 🧪 Labs Overview

### Lab 1 — Python Calculator
A simple interactive calculator demonstrating basic Python operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Serves as the foundation for understanding program flow and I/O handling.

```bash
cd lab_1 && python lab1.py
```

---

### Lab 2 — Multithreading vs Multiprocessing
A **Grade Weighted Average (GWA)** calculator that compares two concurrency approaches:

- **Multithreading** — shared memory, GIL-limited, ideal for I/O-bound tasks
- **Multiprocessing** — separate processes, bypasses GIL, true parallelism for CPU-bound work

Explores data chunking, locks, queues, and the trade-offs between thread and process overhead.

```bash
cd lab_2 && python lab2.py
```

---

### Lab 3 — Task and Data Parallelism
A **Philippine payroll deduction calculator** using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`:

- Computes **SSS**, **PhilHealth**, **Pag-IBIG**, and **income tax** (TRAIN law)
- Demonstrates **task parallelism** (different deduction types in parallel)
- Uses `submit()` and `Future` objects for concurrent execution

```bash
cd lab_3 && python lab3.py
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- No external dependencies — uses only the standard library (`threading`, `multiprocessing`, `concurrent.futures`)

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways

- **GIL** limits true parallelism in threads; use **multiprocessing** for CPU-bound work
- **Threading** excels at I/O-bound tasks with minimal overhead
- **ProcessPoolExecutor** enables true parallelism; **ThreadPoolExecutor** is lighter for I/O
- **Task parallelism** = different tasks; **Data parallelism** = same task on different data
